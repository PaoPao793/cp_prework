## App Brainstorming 

### Favorite Applications 
1. TikTok
- Different tabs for different videos, STEM, from people you follor, for you page, etc. I think it makes it easier to build a strong for you page you like and then when you want to catch up with peopke you follow, go to that tab. 
2. Spotify 
- puts most listened playlists on top of homepage
- easy to add songs to a playlist or queue by swiping on songs left or right 
3. Diary app for Apple 
- Word count, counted entries per year, etc really cool to see. 
- Different prompts or add ons for entries are cool to play with when I use the app since it gives me stuff to add to the entry and makes it more fun to use. 
4. Books App 
- Being able to separate books into different collections. Some of them are default theres like finished, books, autdiobooks, pdfs, etc but being able to make custom ones is also useful. 

### Potential App 
An app I would like to build is a general finder for movies, series, etc. One thing that always bothers me is that when I hear about a movie or something to watch, I have to hunt around on Google for where I can find it and then depending on the service it is hosted in I can or can not watch it. I think an app where you can just put the name and it searches to give you the list of services would be useful as it eliminates the need to go on google everytime. Amazon video does something similar but this is something for which you already need a subscription to use so I think I would appreciate an app that does it separately from one service. 

Potentially having a system where you can add your friends and potentially share subscriptions would be good to add too. Thought that would bring up some concerns about the legality of the feature considering most services do not want password sharing.
